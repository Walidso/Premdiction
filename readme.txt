summary of the project:

This project involves creating a simple RESTful Flask API application named 'PREMDIKTION'. The purpose of this application is to allow users to make predictions on the outcome of Premier League football matches.

The basic functionalities of this app include:

1. User Registration and Login: Users can register with a username and password. Passwords are hashed for security purposes.

2. Making Predictions: Once registered, users can make predictions on the outcome of Premier League matches. The outcomes can be '1' (team1 wins), 'X' (draw), or '2' (team2 wins). These predictions are stored in a SQLite database.

3. Updating Match Results and Scores: The app fetches real match data from the external football-data.org API. Once a match is over, its result can be updated in the app. If a user's prediction matches the actual result, their score is incremented.

4. Viewing Predictions and High Scores: Users can view all predictions made and the current high scores.

The app provides a variety of endpoints for these functionalities, including endpoints for registration (`/register`), login (`/login`), creating predictions (`/predictions`), updating match results (`/matches/<id>`), viewing high scores (`/users/high_scores`), and more.

To interact with the app, you can use an HTTP client like Postman. You can send HTTP requests to the provided endpoints to perform the various operations. For example, you can send a POST request with a JSON body to the `/register` endpoint to register a new user.

The app is designed to be simple, focusing primarily on backend functionalities and providing responses in JSON format. It doesn't involve any frontend HTML or CSS elements, as it's meant to be tested and interacted with using Postman or a similar tool.

The code for the app is split into two main Python files: `app.py`, which contains the Flask app and route definitions, and `models.py`, which defines the SQLAlchemy database models. The app uses the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension for ORM functionalities.

The project also involves creating a Swagger YAML documentation for the API, which provides a detailed description of all the app's endpoints and can be used to generate a user-friendly API documentation.

Overall, this project provides an example of how to develop a simple yet functional RESTful API with Flask, integrate it with an external API, and use SQLAlchemy for database operations.
